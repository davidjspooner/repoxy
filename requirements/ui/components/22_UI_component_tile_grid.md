# Component: Tile Grid

Layout component for arranging tiles such as `RepoTypeTile`.

## Responsibilities

- Arrange child tiles in a responsive grid or list.
- Handle cases where the number of tiles changes (e.g. new repo types appear).

## Behaviour

- Desktop:
  - Multi-column grid.
- Mobile:
  - One or two columns depending on screen width.

The Tile Grid is a simple layout helper; all semantics and actions belong to the child tiles.
