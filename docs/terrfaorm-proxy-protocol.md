## What Is the Provider Network Mirror Protocol?

### Terraform

* This protocol provides an **alternative installation source** for Terraform providers, independent of origin registries.
* It allows you to configure Terraform CLI to download provider binaries from a **single internal network mirror**, even if those providers originate from different hostnames or registries. ([HashiCorp Developer][1], [opentofu.org][2]).
* It’s **not** meant for implementing an origin registry; for that you’d use the provider *registry* protocol instead ([HashiCorp Developer][1]).

### OpenTofu

* Works the same way: it's an optional mechanism to serve providers from a custom mirror, which can host providers from any registry hostname. ([opentofu.org][3]).
* Also distinct from provider registry protocol, which is used when implementing origin registries. ([opentofu.org][3]).

## How It Works

1. **Configuration in CLI**

   In your CLI configuration file (`.terraformrc`, `terraform.rc`, or `tofu.rc`), you enable a network mirror like so:

   #### Terraform example:

   ```hcl
   provider_installation {
     network_mirror {
       url = "https://terraform.example.com/providers/"
     }
   }
   ```

   The `url` must use `https://` and end with a trailing slash. Terraform resolves mirror requests using this base URL. ([opentofu.org][2], [HashiCorp Developer][1])

   #### OpenTofu example:

   ```hcl
   provider_installation {
     network_mirror {
       url = "https://tofu.example.com/providers/"
     }
   }
   ```

   Works in exactly the same way. ([opentofu.org][3])

2. **URL Constructs**

   Terraform/OpenTofu builds requests relative to the base URL. A request for a provider might look like:

   ```
   https://mirror.example.com/:hostname/:namespace/:type/index.json
   ```

   Here, `:hostname` refers to the provider’s original registry host, not the mirror’s host. ([opentofu.org][3], [HashiCorp Developer][1])

3. **Fetching Providers**

   * The client retrieves an `index.json` listing available versions, then fetches the specific provider binary (`.zip`) for the appropriate OS/architecture.
   * A mirror doesn't need to host *all* platforms—just what your environment requires. ([HashiCorp Developer][1])

4. **Mirroring Tools**

   * **Terraform CLI** includes the `terraform providers mirror` command to generate a filesystem-based mirror that includes the proper `.zip` files and JSON indices. This directory can be deployed as a static mirror (e.g., HTTP server) ([HashiCorp Developer][4]).
   * **OpenTofu** has a similar command: `tofu providers mirror`, supporting the same logic and optional platform targeting ([opentofu.org][5]).

5. **Security / Signing Considerations**

   * When using a mirror, Terraform/OpenTofu trusts that mirror implicitly. It does not verify upstream provider signatures via the mirror. You only get TLS-based integrity checks on the mirror itself. ([HashiCorp Discuss][6]).
   * If provider binary signature verification is important, you need to run a **private provider registry** implementing the provider registry protocol, rather than using a mirror.
